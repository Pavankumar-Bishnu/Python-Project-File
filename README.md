# PANIC_ATTACK_ANALYSIS Using Jupyter Notebook. (Health Domain)

> **Data Objective :** ( Purpose of the Dataset )

This dataset appears designed to analyze factors that influence panic attacks and potentially predict panic severity or frequency based on physiological, behavioral, and lifestyle attributes.

> **Project Insights**

- Total Records                      1,200
- Features                         : 21 (mix of demographic, lifestyle, medical history, and panic-related data)
  - Demographics & Panic Attacks   : Compare panic frequency and severity across age groups and genders.
  - Triggers & Lifestyle           : See if high caffeine intake, low sleep, or smoking link to more frequent/severe panic attacks.
  - Symptoms                       : Which symptoms (sweating, chest pain, etc.) are most common with high panic scores
  - Medical History                : Does history of anxiety/depression correlate with higher severity.
  - Treatment Effectiveness        : Check whether therapy/medication lowers panic frequency or score.
- Sleep deprivation, caffeine, and alcohol intake could be modifiable risk factors.
- Anxiety and depression are common underlying conditions.
- Even with medication or therapy, many still have high panic scores → treatment effectiveness could be explored further.
- There’s potential to build a predictive model using these features to estimate panic severity panicscore.

## **Final Conclusion:**
- Panic attacks are most prevalent in middle-aged individuals with a strong link to anxiety and PTSD history.
- Lifestyle factors such as low sleep, caffeine, and moderate alcohol use may be aggravating triggers.
- Therapy participation is almost equal, suggesting mixed approaches to management.
- Data shows a moderate average severity, but high variability across individuals.
